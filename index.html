            <p>These are unprecedented times when old convictions are torn just like paper sheet.</p>
            <p>If in the past we could not assume disorientation - even though we felt it - now more than ever we are open to discuss vulnerability.</p>
            <p>More than that, we understood that it's ok to feel a bit lost, because we were forced to realize that the only certainty is the uncertainty.</p>
            <p>But what if, magically, we could see the future and transform our uncertainty into a direction? Someone to solve our needs even before we realize we need it?</p>
            <p>We can say Compass UOL is a bit closer to the future than most of us, right? Because these people are passionate about what the future will bring us.</p>
            <p>But if it's a big ambition to show a direction to the future, it is also in its very DNA, its own name.</p>
            <p class="spanColor">To be a Compass.</p>
            <p>Let's embrace it.</p>
